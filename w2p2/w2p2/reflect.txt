During this workshop, I delved deeper into C++ programming concepts such as class implementation, file I/O operations, timing measurements, and namespace usage through the creation of the ProteinDatabase and TimedTask classes. 
I reinforced my understanding of constructors, member functions, private data members, and encapsulation while handling file input/output operations with ifstream for reading data and parsing file contents. 

Additionally, I learned about timing measurements using the <chrono> library to measure task execution time and namespace usage for code organization and prevention of naming conflicts.

While troubleshooting issues related to namespace conflicts and header file inclusion, I grasped the significant time difference between copy and move operations, comprehending that copy operations involve duplicating the object's contents, which can be time-consuming, while move operations transfer resources from one object to another more efficiently.

Another hurdle was using std::move correctly to transfer resources without unintentionally causing undefined behaviour. It was crucial to make sure that the source object's state remained valid and destructible after the move.
Overall, this workshop has significantly improved my practical skills in managing C++ resources and optimizing performance. It has offered valuable insights into effective coding practices and underscored the importance of comprehending underlying mechanisms for writing resilient and efficient code.}
